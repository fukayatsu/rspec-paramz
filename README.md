# RSpec::Paramz [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fukayatsu/rspec-paramz.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fukayatsu/rspec-paramz)

Simple Parameterized Test for RSpec.

Inspired by [tomykaira/rspec-parameterized](https://github.com/tomykaira/rspec-parameterized).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'rspec-paramz'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install rspec-paramz

## Usage

See [paramz_spec.rb](https://github.com/fukayatsu/rspec-paramz/blob/master/spec/rspec/paramz_spec.rb) for example.

```ruby

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
